# ðŸŽ’ Installation

## Option 1: Via Curseforge (Recommended)

This is the simplest and official method.

1. Open the [CurseForge Modpack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/ubingo) site.
2. In the top-right corner click the orange <mark style="color:blue;background-color:orange;">Install</mark> Button.&#x20;
3. If you have the CurseForge Launcher already installed then click in the pop-up _Yes, open CurseForge app_ else if you don't have the launcher then click on _No, I need Curseforge._
4. So If you already have it then the CurseForge Launcher should now start and install the modpack but if you dont download Curseforge from the opened site from step 3 or click [here](https://download.curseforge.com) when you installed it then head over to step 1 again.&#x20;

## Option 2: via GDLauncher

This is for more _advanced_ users. But I will explain this here in an extra option because this is my at least my favourite launcher.

1. Download the GDLauncher from ther [website](https://gdevs.io).
2. After Installation follow the installation (I'd recommend the _Automatic Setup_) and add your Minecraft account.
3. Click on the <mark style="background-color:blue;">+</mark> in the buttom-left corner.
4. Select Curseforge and Search **uBingo**.
5. Hover over it and click on Download Latest and follow the setup.

## Option 3: via any other Launcher

We _(Unately)_ do **NOT** support any other Launcher than the both aprove. We only can say this:

* You can always download the latest modpack zip file **(in curseforge format)** from our [GitHub](https://github.com/Unately/uBingo/releases/latest).
* If you have any questions related to this don't ask any team member (you will get ignored). You could ask in the community help channel in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/msqZF3ZQ84) or in the Off-Topic Category of our GitHub [discussions](https://github.com/Unately/uBingo/discussions/categories/off-topic).
