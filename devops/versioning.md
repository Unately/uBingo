# ðŸš© Versioning

### General Releases

For General Releases we're using the following format: **MAYOR.MINOR**\
****\
**MAYOR:** This are **** complete new releases like a complete rewrite wich breaks the API or UI\
**MINOR:** adds backwards-compatible bug fixes, changes and functionality does not breaks API or add big Features.\
\
If you're hotfixing something then you use this format: **MAYOR.MINOR.PATCH**\
\
**PATCH:** Only adds backwards-compatible bug fixes.

### Development Versions

For Development there are additional formats: **MAYOR.MINOR.PATCH.LABEL**\
****\
**LABEL:** This is used for pre-releases like rc1 or beta3. These could bee used in the following format beta -> rc -> stable and _are not released!_
